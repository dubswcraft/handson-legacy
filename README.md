I based a lot of this session on the work of Sandro Mancuso, Adrian Balboca and Samir Talwar. 
The source is the same as their github repos with a few modifactations so that we could add golden master

What is it about?
-----------------

Provides an example of existing code that needs to be unit tested. But there is one rule:

> We can't change any existing code if not covered by tests. The only exception is if we need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed. 

Although this is a very small piece of code, it has a lot of the problems that we find in legacy code.
